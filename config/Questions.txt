Questions:

1. Error checking - how much and how detailed?
2. Failure:
    - exit(1)?
    - throw()?
    - Something else?
    - Failure code: 0 or 1, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE?
3. How to return multiple values
    - vector<int>, int*
    - vector<float>, float*
    - Do we anticipate anything more complex than ((0,0,0,1), (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0))?
4. Method overload
    - template <typename T> getValue(string settingName)
        - int tmp = getValue<int>(settingName);
5. Parse the config properties
    - At the initialization time? (may save some cycles)
    - Do the parsing on the fly?
