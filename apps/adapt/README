This directory contains a dumb little glut program called adaptee.cpp,
and an adaptation of that program called adapted.cpp that uses MinVR
to coordinate multiple processes.

To run it, open three windows, and run the server in the first window:

  adapted_server mvr.xml

Then run two instances of the adapted code in two other terminal
windows:

  adapted Display1 mvr.xml
  adapted Display2 mvr.xml

The second argument is the name of the instance running, and will be
used to select data for that instance from the mvr.xml configuration
file.

The server function makes up some events to pass along to the clients.
You'll see that the two clients react to them in different ways
because the "radius event" changes the value of a default radius,
which is set up to only affect Display2.  The client in Display1
has an explicitly set radius that is not affected by the default
level.  This is set up in the mvr.xml file, so look there to see more
detail.
