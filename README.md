# MinVR

MinVR is an Open Source Project developed and maintained by the University of Minnesota's Interactive Visualization Lab.

The goal of MinVR is to faciliate a variety of data visualization and virtual reality research projects by providing a robust, cross-platform VR toolkit for use with many different VR displays (e.g., CAVE's, PowerWalls, multi-touch stereoscopic tables, 3DTV's, head-mounted displays) and input devices (e.g., 6 degree-of-freedom trackers, multi-touch input devices, haptic devices, home-built devices).
